Shop Management
========================
#### [Live Demo](http://li118-165.members.linode.com:8080)

Just a very simple Spring Boot Web App to showcase my skills.

### What can it do?

One of the facilities of an e-commerce application is to manage merchants. Some merchant's shops are only open
for a certain period of days. This humble web app wishes to address one of its problems which is to
provide a facility to update shop active dates in bulk by importing a CSV file. Additionally, a search facility
is provided to search for opened shops for a given day.

### Technological Considerations

Let's go geek in here!

#### Architecture 

It is worthwhile to discuss the architecture behind the trivial application. The architecture is designed after the
inspiration of vertical slices as presented [here](http://olivergierke.de/2013/01/whoops-where-did-my-architecture-go/) 
by Oliver Gierke, the Spring Data Project Lead at Pivotal. Coincidentally, he is also an advocate of domain driven design. 
Furthermore, I have listed all the technologies that I've used in this project. This may be overkill for such a trivial
application but if this application were to be extended, I believe the architecture is strong enough to accommodate the
increasing complexity of the business domain.
