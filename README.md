Shop Management
========================
#### [Live Demo](http://li118-165.members.linode.com:8080)

Just a very simple Spring Boot Web App to showcase my skills.


### What can it do?

One of the facilities of an e-commerce application is to manage merchants. Some merchant's shops are only open
for a certain period of days. This humble web app wishes to address one of its problems which is to
provide a facility to update shop active dates in bulk by importing a CSV file. Additionally, a search facility
is provided to search for opened shops for a given day.
